                            In Kenya, many of the students with Dyslexia are not given the academic accommodations they
                            need to succeed. They are often told to “work harder” by teachers that have never heard of
                            learning disabilities, or they have teachers who do not believe Dyslexia is a real
                            diagnosis. As a result, many Dyslexic students face expulsion, or simply quit their
                            education, before they enter high school.

                            After helping their Dyslexic sons earn their diplomas and continue their educations at a
                            University, Nancy Munyi and Phyllis Kariuki took up the challenge of starting a school that
                            would help other Dyslexic students succeed. The Rare Gem Talent School was conceived of and
                            founded in 2012 - Nancy and Phyllis picked the name “Rare Gem” as a metaphor to describe the
                            extremely talented Dyslexic students that are often overlooked by conventional schools. The
                            school began in a rented three-bedroomed house that the founders struggled to transform into
                            an educational space that would positively impact the lives of the first 10 children who
                            made up the student body.
